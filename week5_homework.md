# Sales processing design challenge

## Actors

* Sales person
* Company owning products
* Commission platform

## Requirements

* Sales person sells a product. They get a commission based on agreed conditions, from the company. The commission platform receives an agreed (with the company) N% from each commission too. 
* Sales people can sell products from different companies
* The company can see, each month, how much they need to pay to each sales person and why
* The platform admins can see hot much they will charge the companies
* The sales person knows at any moment how much of their sales they made - how much commission was made


## What ifs

* we get a sale information, but the product was not provided yet?
* we get a sale info, but we don't have the commission agreement with the sales man?
* what if the commission agreement can change, also back in time?
